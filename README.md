# Final Project - Movie_Pick

## Team member: 
Camille Evangelista, Aline Hornoff, Edbert Widjaja, Carmen Sin

## Scope of the project
When was the last time on a rainy day, you curled up on the couch ready to watch a movie finding yourself overwhelmed by the sheer amount of movie choices spending ages figuring out what movie to watch? 

Well, gone are the times of endless scrolling through movies to find the one to watch. 
Enter your mood, the movie genre, release year of the movie or the time you have available to watch the movie in the interactive dashboard and it will give you a top 5 movie recommendation.
